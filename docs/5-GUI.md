##  WINDOW
The provided code is using the ImGui library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) window with a specific ID (`id`) and configure its size and position.

Here's a breakdown of each line:

1. `ImGui::Begin(id);`:
   - `ImGui::Begin()` is a function from the ImGui library used to start creating a new GUI window.
   - The `id` parameter is a unique identifier for the window. It allows ImGui to differentiate between different windows and maintain their states.
   - The `ImGui::Begin()` function sets up the context for creating a new GUI window, and any GUI elements created after this call will belong to this window until the corresponding `ImGui::End()` function is called.

2. `ImGui::SetWindowSize(id, size);`:
   - `ImGui::SetWindowSize()` is a function that sets the size of the specified window.
   - The `id` parameter should match the `id` used in the corresponding `ImGui::Begin()` call to identify the window.
   - The `size` parameter is a `ImVec2` vector representing the desired size of the window in pixels. For example, `ImVec2(width, height)`.

3. `ImGui::SetWindowPos(id, position);`:
   - `ImGui::SetWindowPos()` is a function that sets the position of the specified window on the screen.
   - The `id` parameter should match the `id` used in the corresponding `ImGui::Begin()` call to identify the window.
   - The `position` parameter is a `ImVec2` vector representing the desired position of the window's top-left corner on the screen in pixels. For example, `ImVec2(x, y)`.

Together, these lines of code set up a new GUI window with a specific ID, configure its size, and position it on the screen. The actual window creation and rendering might occur in later parts of the code.

Keep in mind that the actual behavior and appearance of the window will depend on the rest of the ImGui code and the rendering loop that ImGui uses. This code snippet represents just a part of the ImGui window creation process.

##  TABBAR - TABITEM
The provided code is using the ImGui library to create a tab bar (`ImGui::BeginTabBar`) and a tab item (`ImGui::BeginTabItem`) within the tab bar. Tabs provide a convenient way to organize and switch between different sections or views in a graphical user interface.

Here's an explanation of each line:

1. `ImGui::BeginTabBar("TabBar")`:
   - `ImGui::BeginTabBar()` is a function from the ImGui library used to start creating a new tab bar.
   - The `"TabBar"` parameter is a unique string identifier for the tab bar. It allows ImGui to differentiate between different tab bars if you have multiple tab bars in your interface.

2. `ImGui::BeginTabItem("CPU")`:
   - `ImGui::BeginTabItem()` is a function that creates a new tab item within the active tab bar. It starts the process of creating a new tab content area associated with the tab.
   - The `"CPU"` parameter is a string that will be displayed as the label of the tab item. It represents the name or title of the tab.

After these two lines, you would typically add the content specific to the "CPU" tab, such as other ImGui widgets like text, graphs, buttons, etc. The content will be associated with the "CPU" tab and will be displayed when that tab is active.

Here's a simple example of how the code might look with additional content:

```cpp
ImGui::BeginTabBar("TabBar");

if (ImGui::BeginTabItem("CPU")) {
    // Content for the "CPU" tab goes here, e.g., ImGui widgets, graphs, etc.
    ImGui::Text("CPU Usage: 50%");
    // ...
    
    ImGui::EndTabItem();
}

if (ImGui::BeginTabItem("GPU")) {
    // Content for the "GPU" tab goes here
    ImGui::Text("GPU Temperature: 70C");
    // ...
    
    ImGui::EndTabItem();
}

ImGui::EndTabBar();
```

In this example, we have two tabs, "CPU" and "GPU," within the tab bar. Depending on which tab is active, different content specific to each tab will be displayed. Each tab item is enclosed within a conditional `if` statement, allowing ImGui to know which tab is currently active and which content to render. The content within each tab is arbitrary and can include various ImGui widgets and visual elements.


##  TEXT/COLORED
The provided code snippets are both functions from the ImGui library used for displaying text in different colors and styles in the graphical user interface (GUI).

1. `ImGui::TextColored()`:
   - `ImGui::TextColored()` is a function that displays text with a specified color in the GUI.
   - The function takes two parameters:
     - The first parameter is a `const ImVec4&` type, representing the color of the text. `ImVec4` is a struct that holds four floating-point values for the red, green, blue, and alpha components of the color.
     - The second parameter is a `const char*` type, representing the text to be displayed.

Example usage of `ImGui::TextColored()`:

```cpp
// Display text in red color
ImGui::TextColored(ImVec4(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f), "Error: Something went wrong!");

// Display text in green color
ImGui::TextColored(ImVec4(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f), "Success: Operation completed!");
```

2. `ImGui::Text()`:
   - `ImGui::Text()` is a function that displays regular text in the GUI.
   - The function takes a single parameter of type `const char*`, representing the text to be displayed.

Example usage of `ImGui::Text()`:

```cpp
// Display regular text
ImGui::Text("Welcome to the application!");
ImGui::Text("Click the button to proceed.");
```

In both cases, the text will be displayed in the ImGui window. However, `ImGui::TextColored()` allows you to customize the text color, which can be useful for highlighting specific information or indicating status in the GUI. On the other hand, `ImGui::Text()` is used for displaying general text without any special color formatting.

You can use these functions in combination with other ImGui widgets to build various elements in your graphical user interface. ImGui provides a wide range of functions for creating GUI elements, such as buttons, sliders, input fields, and more, allowing you to design interactive and visually appealing applications.

##  PROGRESSBAR
The provided code uses the ImGui library to create a progress bar in the graphical user interface (GUI). The progress bar represents the CPU usage and displays the current CPU utilization as a visual indicator.

Here's an explanation of the function call:

`ImGui::ProgressBar(system.cpu_usage, ImVec2(-1, 0), "")`:

- `ImGui::ProgressBar()` is a function from the ImGui library used to create a progress bar.
- The function takes three parameters:
  - The first parameter, `system.cpu_usage`, represents the current CPU usage as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0. The value of `system.cpu_usage` should be in this range to display the progress correctly. For example, if the CPU usage is 50%, you would pass `0.5` as the value.
  - The second parameter, `ImVec2(-1, 0)`, is an `ImVec2` vector specifying the size of the progress bar. In this case, `ImVec2(-1, 0)` means the progress bar will automatically adjust its width to fill the available space horizontally.
  - The third parameter is an optional string (`const char*`) that can be used as a label for the progress bar. In this case, an empty string (`""`) is provided, indicating that there is no label associated with the progress bar.

Example usage of `ImGui::ProgressBar()`:

```cpp
float cpuUsage = 0.75f; // Example CPU usage value (75%)

// Display a progress bar for CPU usage
ImGui::ProgressBar(cpuUsage, ImVec2(-1, 0), "");
```

The progress bar will visually represent the `cpuUsage` value, showing the progress of the CPU usage as a bar that fills a portion of the available width in the ImGui window. The length of the filled portion of the progress bar will correspond to the CPU usage percentage.

You can use this progress bar in your ImGui-based GUI to provide users with a visual representation of CPU usage or any other value that can be displayed as a progress indicator.

##  SAMELINE
In the ImGui library, `ImGui::SameLine()` is a function that allows you to place the next ImGui widget or element on the same line as the previous one within the graphical user interface (GUI). It is a useful function when you want to arrange elements horizontally in a row, making your GUI more compact and organized.

Here's how `ImGui::SameLine()` works:

```cpp
// Example usage of ImGui::SameLine()
ImGui::Text("Label 1:");
ImGui::SameLine();
ImGui::Button("Button 1");
```

In this example, the text "Label 1:" and the button "Button 1" will appear on the same line, side by side. The `ImGui::Text()` function is used to display the label, and the `ImGui::Button()` function is used to create a clickable button. By using `ImGui::SameLine()` between these two elements, they are placed next to each other horizontally.

This can be particularly useful when you want to create compact layouts, such as labels followed by corresponding input fields, buttons, or other widgets. It helps improve the overall user experience by organizing related elements in a visually coherent manner.

You can also use `ImGui::SameLine()` to create more complex layouts with multiple elements placed in various configurations within the same row or line.

```cpp
// Example of multiple widgets on the same line
ImGui::Button("Button 1");
ImGui::SameLine();
ImGui::Button("Button 2");
ImGui::SameLine();
ImGui::Button("Button 3");
```

In this example, three buttons are placed side by side on the same line, thanks to the use of `ImGui::SameLine()` between them.

Overall, `ImGui::SameLine()` is a valuable tool for managing the placement of elements within your ImGui-based graphical user interface and creating visually pleasing and well-organized layouts.

##  PLOTLINES
`ImGui::PlotLines()` is a function from the ImGui library that allows you to display a simple line chart or plot within your graphical user interface (GUI). It is useful for visualizing data trends, time series, or any other data that can be represented as a series of data points connected by lines.

Here's the syntax of `ImGui::PlotLines()`:

```cpp
void ImGui::PlotLines(
    const char* label,
    const float* values,
    int values_count,
    int values_offset = 0,
    const char* overlay_text = NULL,
    float scale_min = FLT_MAX,
    float scale_max = FLT_MAX,
    ImVec2 graph_size = ImVec2(0, 0),
    int stride = sizeof(float)
);
```

Parameters:

- `label`: The label for the plot. It will be displayed as the title of the plot.

- `values`: A pointer to an array of floating-point values representing the data points to be plotted.

- `values_count`: The number of data points in the `values` array to be plotted.

- `values_offset`: (Optional) The index of the first data point to be plotted. Defaults to 0, which means plotting from the beginning of the `values` array.

- `overlay_text`: (Optional) An additional text that can be displayed at the top-right corner of the plot as an overlay.

- `scale_min`: (Optional) The minimum value on the Y-axis. If `FLT_MAX` is used (default), ImGui will automatically determine the minimum value.

- `scale_max`: (Optional) The maximum value on the Y-axis. If `FLT_MAX` is used (default), ImGui will automatically determine the maximum value.

- `graph_size`: (Optional) An `ImVec2` vector specifying the size of the plot. A value of `ImVec2(0, 0)` (default) will automatically use the available space.

- `stride`: (Optional) The stride between consecutive data points in the `values` array, in bytes. By default, it is set to the size of a float (4 bytes).

Example usage of `ImGui::PlotLines()`:

```cpp
const float data[] = { 0.2f, 0.5f, 0.8f, 1.2f, 1.5f, 1.7f, 1.3f, 0.9f, 0.6f };
const int dataCount = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

ImGui::PlotLines("Line Plot", data, dataCount);
```

In this example, the `ImGui::PlotLines()` function is used to create a line plot named "Line Plot" using the `data` array as the data points to be plotted. The line plot will automatically scale to fit the available space, and the Y-axis range will be determined automatically based on the data in the `data` array.

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the plot using additional parameters of the `ImGui::PlotLines()` function, such as specifying custom Y-axis range, providing overlay text, adjusting the plot size, and more.

Overall, `ImGui::PlotLines()` is a versatile and straightforward function to create line plots in your ImGui-based graphical user interface. It can be used for various purposes, such as visualizing real-time data, performance metrics, and other data trends.

##  SLIDER
`ImGui::SliderInt()` is a function from the ImGui library that creates a slider widget for integer values in the graphical user interface (GUI). The slider allows users to adjust a value within a specified range by dragging a slider thumb or clicking on the slider track.

Here's the syntax of `ImGui::SliderInt()`:

```cpp
bool ImGui::SliderInt(
    const char* label,
    int* v,
    int v_min,
    int v_max,
    const char* format = "%d"
);
```

Parameters:

- `label`: The label or text displayed next to the slider.

- `v`: A pointer to an integer variable that represents the value controlled by the slider.

- `v_min`: The minimum value of the slider.

- `v_max`: The maximum value of the slider.

- `format`: (Optional) A format string to control the display format of the integer value. The default format is `"%d"`.

The return value of `ImGui::SliderInt()` is a bool indicating whether the slider value has been changed by the user. You can use this return value to perform additional actions or logic when the slider value is modified.

Example usage of `ImGui::SliderInt()`:

```cpp
int value = 50;
int minRange = 0;
int maxRange = 100;

// Display a slider for the integer value
bool valueChanged = ImGui::SliderInt("Slider", &value, minRange, maxRange);

// Use the value of 'value' to control some functionality in the application
if (valueChanged) {
    // Value has been changed by the user, do something...
    // For example, update some settings based on the new value.
}
```

In this example, we create a slider labeled "Slider" using `ImGui::SliderInt()`. The value of the slider is controlled by the `value` integer variable, and it can be adjusted between the `minRange` and `maxRange` values. The `valueChanged` variable will be set to `true` when the user modifies the slider value, allowing you to respond to the user's interaction if needed.

Using `ImGui::SliderInt()` is a convenient way to allow users to adjust integer values interactively in your ImGui-based graphical user interface, such as setting preferences, parameters, or numerical settings.

##  CHECKBOX
`ImGui::Checkbox()` is a function from the ImGui library that creates a checkbox widget in the graphical user interface (GUI). A checkbox allows users to toggle between two states, usually represented as "checked" or "unchecked" (true or false). It's a simple and commonly used UI element to enable or disable a feature or option.

Here's the syntax of `ImGui::Checkbox()`:

```cpp
bool ImGui::Checkbox(const char* label, bool* v);
```

Parameters:

- `label`: The label or text displayed next to the checkbox.

- `v`: A pointer to a bool variable that represents the state of the checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, the value pointed to by `v` will be set to `true`, and when the checkbox is unchecked, the value will be set to `false`.

The return value of `ImGui::Checkbox()` is a bool indicating whether the checkbox is currently checked (`true`) or unchecked (`false`). You can use this return value to perform additional actions or logic based on the state of the checkbox, although it's common to use the `bool* v` parameter directly to read the state of the checkbox.

Example usage of `ImGui::Checkbox()`:

```cpp
bool enableFeature = false;

// Display a checkbox labeled "Enable Feature"
ImGui::Checkbox("Enable Feature", &enableFeature);

// Use the value of enableFeature to control some functionality in the application
if (enableFeature) {
    // Feature is enabled, do something...
} else {
    // Feature is disabled, do something else...
}
```

In this example, we create a checkbox labeled "Enable Feature" using `ImGui::Checkbox()`. The state of the checkbox is controlled by the `enableFeature` boolean variable. When the checkbox is checked, `enableFeature` will be set to `true`, and when it's unchecked, it will be set to `false`. The state of `enableFeature` can be used to control specific functionality or behavior in the application.

Using `ImGui::Checkbox()` is an easy and effective way to add user-controlled boolean options to your ImGui-based GUI, allowing users to enable or disable certain features or settings as needed.

##  COLUMNS - NEXTCOLUMN - SEPARATOR
In ImGui, you can use `ImGui::Columns()`, `ImGui::NextColumn()`, and `ImGui::Separator()` functions to create tables and organize your GUI elements into columns. These functions allow you to arrange widgets in a tabular format, similar to how you would create a table in traditional UI design.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use these functions to create a basic table:

1. Begin the table using `ImGui::Columns()`. This function sets up a new column layout.

2. Define the number of columns you want in the table using the `int count` parameter of `ImGui::Columns()`. For example, if you want three columns, use `ImGui::Columns(3)`.

3. Add your widgets or elements to each column. Use `ImGui::NextColumn()` after adding each widget to move to the next column. This function serves as a column separator and advances the layout to the next column.

4. Insert separators between columns using `ImGui::Separator()` to make the table visually clear.

5. End the table using `ImGui::Columns()`.

Here's an example of how to create a simple table with three columns and three rows:

```cpp
void ShowTable()
{
    ImGui::Columns(3, "MyTable", true); // 3 columns table

    // First row
    ImGui::Text("Header 1");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 1
    ImGui::Text("Header 2");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 2
    ImGui::Text("Header 3");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 3
    ImGui::Separator(); // Separator after the header row

    // Second row
    ImGui::Text("Data 1");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 1
    ImGui::Text("Data 2");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 2
    ImGui::Text("Data 3");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 3
    ImGui::Separator(); // Separator after the second row

    // Third row
    ImGui::Text("More Data 1");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 1
    ImGui::Text("More Data 2");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 2
    ImGui::Text("More Data 3");  ImGui::NextColumn(); // Column 3

    ImGui::Columns(1); // Restore layout to a single column (optional, not needed in this example)
}
```

In this example, we use `ImGui::Columns(3)` to set up a table with three columns. We then use `ImGui::Text()` to display the header and data for each column, followed by `ImGui::NextColumn()` to move to the next column. After each row, we use `ImGui::Separator()` to create a visual separator between the rows.

Remember that the number of columns in the table must match the number of `ImGui::NextColumn()` calls; otherwise, the layout will be incorrect.

You can extend this concept to create more complex tables with additional rows and columns. Tables are a powerful way to organize data and improve the readability of your ImGui-based graphical user interface.
