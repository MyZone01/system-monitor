#   üñ•Ô∏è SYSTEM MONITOR
##  DESCRIPTION
System monitor is an application you are about to work on is a [**Desktop System Monitor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_monitor). The app will monitor the computer system resources and performance, such as CPU, RAM, SWAP, Fan, Network and more.
For the GUI you will use the [_Dear ImGui_](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm) library for C++.

##  USAGE
```sh
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
$ make setup
$ make
$ ./build/monitor
```

##  STEPS

+   [x] **System monitor**, that will contain :
    +   [x] The type of OS (Operating System).
    +   [x] The user logged into the computer.
    +   [x] The computer name, this being the **hostname**.
    +   [x] The total number of tasks/processes that are currently running, sleeping, uninterruptible, zombie, traced/stopped or interrupted.
    +   [x] Type of CPU
    +   [x] A tabbed section containing `CPU`, `Power`, `Fan` and `Thermal` information, this information include a performance graphic for all those topics.
    +   [x] This graph should contain some kind of checkbox or button to be able to stop the animation whenever the user desires to do so.
    +   [x] Additionally, it should also have two slider bars. The first slider bar should be able to control the `FPS` of the graph, and the second slider bar should control the `y` scale of the graph.
    +   [x] `CPU` should present this graph with an overlay text saying the current percentage of the CPU.
    +   [ ] `Fan`, should include the following information, the status of the fan, (enable/active), the current speed and the level. And should also present the graph stated above.
    +   [x] `Thermal`, should present the graph stated above with an overlay text saying the current temperature of the computer (usually the cpu sensor).

+   [x] **Memory and process monitor**, that will contain :
    +   [x] The Physic Memory (RAM) being used, it must have some kind of visual display of this usage.
    +   [x] The Virtual Memory (SWAP) being used, it should also include a visual display.
    +   [x] The Disk usage, same here.
    +   [x] A tab bar that should contain a table of processes with the following columns :
    +   [x] **PID**, with the process identification.
    +   [x] **Name**, name of the process.
    +   [x] **State**, current state of the process.
    +   [x] **CPU usage**, how much CPU the process is using in percentage.
    +   [x] **Memory usage**, how much memory the process is using in percentage.
    +   [x] A text box that lets the user filter the table.
    +   [x] **Users must be able to select multiple rows of the table.**

+   [x] **Network**, that will contain :
    +   [x] The network ipv4, (`lo`, `wlp5s0` and other networks that the computer may have).
    +   [x] A tab bar that should contain two tables :
    +   [x] `RX` (network receiver) containing the following data : bytes, packets, errs, drop, fifo, frame, compressed and multicast.
    +   [x] `TX` (network transmitter) containing the following data : bytes, packets, errs, drop, fifo, colls, carrier and compressed.
    +   [x] It should also contain a tabbed section for both `RX` and `TX`, those sections should display a visual usage (ex: a progress bar), of all network present on the computer. This visual display should obey the following rules:
    +   [x] Each network should be converted from **bytes** to **GB**, **KB** or **MB** depending on the value. It should not display values that
      are too big or too small. In other words it should be adjustable.
        **452755738 bytes** => **431.78 MB**. // perfect\
        **452755738 bytes** => **0.42 GB**. // too small\
        **452755738 bytes** => **442144.28.6 KB**. // too big
    +   [ ] The visual display should go from 0GB to 2GB
